# HackBI4-PythonWorkshopHS
> A workshop for high schoolers to learn the basics of Python, which is a general purpose coding language.  

## Get Started
First download Python 3: https://www.python.org/ Second, download the code editor PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

## Uses
Python is a versatile language. It can be used for software development, web development, scientific computing and data science, and more.  

## Purpose
This workshop will teach the high school participants the basic fundamentals of Python so that they have a foundation for Python projects they might want to create on their own. 

## Goal
The goal of this workshop is to teach the participants how to use print statements, if/elif/else statements, and mathematical operators (such as modulus).

## Challenges
1. Check if a number from the user is odd or even and if it's divisible by a certain number. 
2. Print the fibonacci sequence based on how many numbers the user wants to print. 
3. Create a shape using print statements.  

## More Stuff
Creating a new Python Project in PyCharm:  When creating a new project in PyCharm, make sure the Base Interpreter is the newest version of Python, which should be version 3. (The default for Macs may be version 2.) 
Creating a Python file in PyCharm: To create a new file, right click on the project folder, click New, then click Python File. Remember that Python file names end in the extension py.
